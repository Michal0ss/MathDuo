# MathDuo ‚Äì Math Tutoring Platform

MathDuo is a modern web application built with **React**, designed to make scheduling math tutoring sessions, presenting the offer, and contacting the team simple and convenient.  
The project was developed in collaboration with my business partner in the tutoring field to provide students and parents with easy access to professional math support.

## üõ† Technologies and Skills Developed

While working on **MathDuo**, I improved my skills in the following areas:

- **React**: functional components, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`), state management, props, conditional rendering  
- **React Router**: navigation between pages *(if used)*  
- **GSAP & ScrollTrigger**: advanced animations, smooth scrolling, React integration via `@gsap/react`  
- **Responsiveness**: designing interfaces for different devices, media queries, dynamic styles  
- **Working with data**: importing JSON files, dynamically displaying available tutoring slots  
- **Team collaboration**: communication, task distribution, joint planning of functionalities  
- **Vite**: fast development environment for React

## In the near future
I plan to extend the platform with features such as:
- User authentication and login ‚Äì allowing students and parents to create accounts
- Subject enrollment directly from the website ‚Äì enabling users to sign up for tutoring sessions online
- Notifications for teacher
